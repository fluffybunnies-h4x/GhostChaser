## Introduction

**GhostChaser** is a Windows-based cyber deception toolkit designed to deploy and manage "Ghosts" - canary resources that act as tripwires across enterprise environments. These Ghosts detect unauthorized access, lateral movement, and malicious activity by triggering alerts when interacted with.

### Why Cyber Deception?

Traditional security focuses on preventing attacks. Cyber deception assumes breach and focuses on **early detection**:

| Approach | Focus | Value |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Prevention | Stop attacks before they happen | Reduces attack surface |
| Detection | Identify attacks in progress | Reduces dwell time |
| **Deception** | Detect attackers during reconnaissance | **Catches attacks before damage** |

### Key Benefits

- **Early Warning**: Detect attackers during reconnaissance, before they reach legitimate assets
- **Low False Positives**: Legitimate users never access Ghost resources - any interaction is suspicious
- **High Fidelity Alerts**: Every Ghost interaction is a strong indicator of malicious activity
- **Attacker Intelligence**: Learn about attacker TTPs based on which Ghosts they trigger

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Windows 10/11 or Windows Server 2016+
- .NET 8.0 Runtime (or use the self-contained executable)
- Administrative privileges for deployment
- Domain Admin privileges (for domain-wide deployments)

### Installation

1. Download the latest release from the repository
2. Run `GhostChaser.exe` - no installation required
3. The application runs as a portable executable

### First Launch

1. Launch GhostChaser
2. Select the Ghost type you want to deploy
3. Configure the Ghost properties
4. Provide deployment credentials (or use current user)
5. Click "Deploy Ghost"

---

## Ghost Types Overview

GhostChaser supports four types of deception resources:

| Ghost Type | Detects | Primary Event IDs |
|------------|---------|-------------------|
| **Account** | Credential theft, brute force, lateral movement | 4624, 4625 |
| **File** | File system reconnaissance, data exfiltration | 4663, 4656 |
| **Share** | Network enumeration, lateral movement | 4663, 5140 |
| **SPN** | Kerberoasting, SPN enumeration | 4769 |

---

## Ghost Accounts (Canary Users)

Ghost Accounts are fake user accounts that trigger alerts on any authentication attempt.

### Use Cases

- Detect credential theft (Mimikatz, secretsdump)
- Detect brute force attacks
- Detect Pass-the-Hash / Pass-the-Ticket attacks
- Detect lateral movement with compromised credentials

### Configuration Options

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Username** | The account username | `svc_backup`, `admin_temp`, `sqlservice` |
| **Account Type** | Local or Domain account | Domain for enterprise |
| **Domain** | Target domain (domain accounts only) | `CORP.LOCAL` |
| **Organizational Unit** | OU path for account creation | `OU=ServiceAccounts,DC=corp,DC=local` |
| **Description** | Custom account description (optional) | Leave blank for realistic default |
| **Group Memberships** | Privileged groups to add account to | Administrators, Domain Admins |

### Security Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Denied Logon Hours** | Domain accounts are created with zero allowed logon hours - authentication fails even with correct credentials |
| **Strong Passwords** | 32-character cryptographically random passwords |
| **Privileged Appearance** | Group memberships make accounts attractive to attackers |

### Deployment Steps

1. Select **Account (User)** as Ghost Type
2. Enter a descriptive **Ghost Name** (e.g., "Backup Service Canary")
3. Enter the **Target System** (local machine or remote hostname)
4. Configure Account Details:
   - Enter a realistic **Username** (see naming conventions below)
   - Choose **Local Account** or **Domain Account**
   - For domain accounts, specify the **Domain** and optional **OU**
   - Optionally enter a custom **Description**
5. Select **Group Memberships** to make the account appear privileged:
   - Administrators, Remote Desktop Users, Backup Operators (all accounts)
   - Domain Admins, Enterprise Admins (domain accounts only)
6. Click **Deploy Ghost**

### Recommended Naming Conventions

Choose usernames that appear legitimate but enticing to attackers:

```
Service Accounts:
  svc_backup, svc_sql, svc_exchange, svc_admin

Admin Accounts:
  admin_temp, admin_legacy, administrator2

Database Accounts:
  dbadmin, sqlservice, oracleadmin

Application Accounts:
  app_service, iis_admin, sharepoint_svc
```

### Detection Events

| Event ID | Description | Log |
|----------|-------------|-----|
| **4624** | Successful logon (shouldn't happen for domain accounts with denied logon hours) | Security |
| **4625** | Failed logon attempt - **primary detection event** | Security |
| **4768** | Kerberos TGT request | Security |
| **4776** | NTLM authentication attempt | Security |

> **Note:** Domain Ghost Accounts have zero allowed logon hours. Any authentication attempt will fail with Event ID 4625, even with correct credentials. This ensures detection while preventing actual account compromise.

### Example SIEM Query (Splunk)

```spl
index=windows sourcetype=WinEventLog:Security
(EventCode=4624 OR EventCode=4625)
TargetUserName IN ("svc_backup", "admin_temp", "sqlservice")
| stats count by TargetUserName, IpAddress, EventCode
| where count > 0
```

|----------|-------------|-----|
| **4663** | Object access (file read/write) | Security |
| **4656** | Handle requested to object | Security |
| **4658** | Handle closed | Security |

### Enabling File Auditing Manually

If GhostChaser's automatic auditing doesn't apply, enable it manually:

```powershell
# Enable auditing on a specific file
$file = "C:\Users\Public\Documents\passwords.txt"
$acl = Get-Acl $file
$auditRule = New-Object System.Security.AccessControl.FileSystemAuditRule(
    "Everyone",
    "ReadData,ReadAttributes",
    "Success,Failure"
)
$acl.AddAuditRule($auditRule)
Set-Acl $file $acl
```

## Ghost SPNs (Kerberoasting Detection)

Ghost SPNs are honey Service Principal Names that detect Kerberoasting attacks - a technique where attackers request TGS tickets for SPNs to crack offline.

### Use Cases

- Detect Kerberoasting attacks (Rubeus, Impacket GetUserSPNs)
- Detect SPN enumeration (PowerView, Kerbrute)
- Detect Active Directory reconnaissance
- Early warning of credential-based attacks

### How Kerberoasting Works

1. Attacker enumerates SPNs in Active Directory
2. Attacker requests TGS tickets for discovered SPNs
3. TGS tickets are encrypted with the service account's password hash
4. Attacker attempts offline brute-force/dictionary attacks
5. If successful, attacker gains the service account password

### Why Honey SPNs Work

- Attackers enumerate **all** SPNs - they can't distinguish honey SPNs
- Any TGS request for a honey SPN indicates attack activity
- Honey SPNs use strong passwords that won't crack offline
- Detection happens **before** the attacker succeeds

### Configuration Options

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Service Class** | SPN service type | `MSSQLSvc`, `HTTP`, `LDAP` |
| **Service Host** | Target hostname (can include port) | `sqlserver.corp.local:1433` |
| **Service Account** | Account to register SPN | `svc_sql_honey` |
| **Domain** | Target domain | `CORP.LOCAL` |
| **Account Description** | Custom description for the service account | Leave blank for realistic default |
| **Create Service Account** | Create new account if needed | Recommended: Yes |
| **Enable Kerberos Auditing** | Enable Event ID 4769 monitoring | Recommended: Yes |

### Security Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Denied Logon Hours** | Service accounts are created with zero allowed logon hours |
| **Strong Passwords** | 32-character cryptographically random passwords that won't crack offline |
| **Complete Removal** | Removing a Ghost SPN also deletes the service account (if created by GhostChaser) |

### Supported Service Classes

GhostChaser includes 20+ enticing service classes:

```
Databases:
  MSSQLSvc, oracle, postgres, mysql, mongodb, redis, elasticsearch

Web Services:
  HTTP, HTTPS, TERMSRV, WSMAN

Infrastructure:
  LDAP, CIFS, HOST, FTP, IMAP, SMTP, POP

Enterprise:
  exchangeMDB, exchangeRFR, kafka
```

### Deployment Steps

1. Select **SPN (Kerberos)** as Ghost Type
2. Enter a descriptive **Ghost Name** (e.g., "SQL Honey SPN")
3. Enter the **Target System** (domain controller or domain name)
4. Configure SPN Details:
   - Select or enter a **Service Class** (e.g., `MSSQLSvc`)
   - Enter the **Service Host** (e.g., `sqlprod.corp.local:1433`)
   - Enter the **Service Account** name (e.g., `svc_sql_backup`)
   - Enter the **Domain**
   - Optionally enter an **Account Description** (leave blank for realistic default)
   - Enable **Create Service Account** if the account doesn't exist
   - Enable **Kerberos Auditing**
5. Click **Deploy Ghost**

### Removal Behavior

When removing a Ghost SPN:
- The SPN registration is removed from Active Directory
- If "Create Service Account" was enabled, the service account is also deleted
- If using an existing account, only the SPN is removed (account preserved)

### Command-Line Alternative

You can also create SPNs manually using `setspn`:

```cmd
# Create the service account first
net user svc_sql_honey P@ssw0rd123! /add /domain

# Register the SPN
setspn -s MSSQLSvc/sqlserver.corp.local:1433 CORP\svc_sql_honey

# Verify the SPN
setspn -L svc_sql_honey
```

### Detection Events

| Event ID | Description | Log |
|----------|-------------|-----|
| **4769** | Kerberos Service Ticket (TGS) requested | Security |
| **4770** | Kerberos Service Ticket renewed | Security |

### Example SIEM Query (Splunk)

```spl
index=windows sourcetype=WinEventLog:Security EventCode=4769
ServiceName IN ("MSSQLSvc/sqlserver.corp.local:1433", "HTTP/webapp.corp.local")
| stats count by ServiceName, TargetUserName, IpAddress
| where count > 0
```

### Example SIEM Query (Microsoft Sentinel)

```kql
SecurityEvent
| where EventID == 4769
| where ServiceName has_any ("sqlserver", "webapp", "honey")
| project TimeGenerated, ServiceName, TargetAccount, IpAddress
| sort by TimeGenerated desc
```

## Detection & Monitoring

### Windows Event Log Configuration

Ensure these audit policies are enabled:

```powershell
# Enable Object Access auditing
auditpol /set /subcategory:"File System" /success:enable /failure:enable
auditpol /set /subcategory:"File Share" /success:enable /failure:enable

# Enable Logon/Logoff auditing
auditpol /set /subcategory:"Logon" /success:enable /failure:enable
auditpol /set /subcategory:"Logoff" /success:enable /failure:enable

# Enable Kerberos auditing
auditpol /set /subcategory:"Kerberos Service Ticket Operations" /success:enable /failure:enable
auditpol /set /subcategory:"Kerberos Authentication Service" /success:enable /failure:enable
```

### Critical Event IDs Summary

| Event ID | Category | Ghost Type | Severity |
|----------|----------|------------|----------|
| 4624 | Logon Success | Account | **CRITICAL** |
| 4625 | Logon Failure | Account | HIGH |
| 4663 | Object Access | File, Share | HIGH |
| 4769 | TGS Request | SPN | **CRITICAL** |
| 5140 | Share Access | Share | HIGH |

### GhostChaser Audit Logs

GhostChaser maintains its own audit logs at:

```
C:\ProgramData\GhostChaser\Logs\GhostChaser_Audit_YYYYMMDD.log
```

Log entries are JSON-formatted for easy parsing:

```json
{
  "Timestamp": "2024-01-15T14:32:18Z",
  "EventType": "GhostCreated",
  "GhostId": "a1b2c3d4-...",
  "GhostType": "SPN",
  "GhostName": "SQL Honey SPN",
  "TargetSystem": "DC01.corp.local",
  "CreatedBy": "admin",
  "Details": {
    "ServicePrincipalName": "MSSQLSvc/sqlprod.corp.local:1433",
    "ServiceAccount": "svc_sql_honey",
    "Domain": "CORP.LOCAL"
  }
}
```

## Deployment Strategies

### Layered Deception

Deploy multiple Ghost types for comprehensive coverage:

```
Layer 1: Network Reconnaissance
├── Ghost Shares on file servers
├── Ghost SPNs in Active Directory
└── Detects: Initial enumeration

Layer 2: Credential Attacks
├── Ghost Accounts in sensitive OUs
├── Ghost SPNs for Kerberoasting
└── Detects: Credential theft, brute force

Layer 3: Lateral Movement
├── Ghost Files on workstations
├── Ghost Shares on servers
└── Detects: Post-exploitation movement

Layer 4: Data Exfiltration
├── Ghost Files with enticing names
├── Auditing on Ghost resources
└── Detects: Data staging/theft
```

### Placement Recommendations

| Location | Ghost Types | Rationale |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| Domain Controllers | SPNs, Accounts | Critical AD targets |
| File Servers | Files, Shares | Data exfiltration detection |
| Database Servers | Files, SPNs | High-value targets |
| Workstations | Files | Lateral movement detection |
| Network Shares | Shares, Files | Ransomware detection |

### Naming Strategy

Make Ghosts realistic but trackable:

```
Pattern: <department>_<function>_<identifier>

Examples:
  Account: svc_backup_prod, admin_legacy_01
  File: passwords_backup.txt, db_credentials.xlsx
  Share: Finance_Archive, IT_Scripts
  SPN: MSSQLSvc/sqlbackup.corp.local:1433
```

---

## SIEM Integration

### Splunk

Create a saved search for Ghost alerts:

```spl
index=windows sourcetype=WinEventLog:Security
(
  (EventCode=4624 OR EventCode=4625) TargetUserName="svc_*_honey"
  OR
  (EventCode=4663 OR EventCode=4656) ObjectName="*passwords*" OR ObjectName="*credentials*"
  OR
  (EventCode=5140) ShareName="*Finance*" OR ShareName="*Backup*"
  OR
  (EventCode=4769) ServiceName="*honey*"
)
| eval AlertType=case(
    EventCode IN (4624, 4625), "Ghost Account Access",
    EventCode IN (4663, 4656), "Ghost File Access",
    EventCode=5140, "Ghost Share Access",
    EventCode=4769, "Kerberoasting Detected"
)
| stats count by AlertType, SourceIP, TargetUserName
```

### Microsoft Sentinel

Create an analytics rule:

```kql
let GhostAccounts = dynamic(["svc_backup_honey", "admin_legacy_honey"]);
let GhostSPNs = dynamic(["MSSQLSvc/sqlhoney", "HTTP/webhoney"]);
let GhostShares = dynamic(["Finance_Honey", "Backup_Honey"]);

SecurityEvent
| where TimeGenerated > ago(1h)
| where
    (EventID in (4624, 4625) and TargetAccount has_any (GhostAccounts))
    or (EventID == 4769 and ServiceName has_any (GhostSPNs))
    or (EventID == 5140 and ShareName has_any (GhostShares))
| project TimeGenerated, Computer, EventID, Account, IpAddress
| extend AlertSeverity = "High"
```

### Elastic SIEM

```json
{
  "query": {
    "bool": {
      "should": [
        {
          "bool": {
            "must": [
              { "terms": { "event.code": ["4624", "4625"] } },
              { "wildcard": { "winlog.event_data.TargetUserName": "*honey*" } }
            ]
          }
        },
        {
          "bool": {
            "must": [
              { "term": { "event.code": "4769" } },
              { "wildcard": { "winlog.event_data.ServiceName": "*honey*" } }
            ]
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Access Denied" During Deployment

```
Cause: Insufficient privileges
Solution: Run GhostChaser as Administrator or provide Domain Admin credentials
```

#### "SPN Already Exists"

```
Cause: Duplicate SPN in the domain
Solution: Use a unique service host name or remove the existing SPN
  setspn -d MSSQLSvc/sqlserver.corp.local:1433 DOMAIN\existing_account
```

#### "Account Already Exists"

```
Cause: Username conflict
Solution: Choose a unique username or remove the existing account
```

#### Events Not Appearing in Logs

```
Cause: Audit policies not configured
Solution: Enable appropriate audit policies (see Detection & Monitoring section)
```

### Verification Commands

```powershell
# Verify Ghost Account exists
Get-ADUser -Identity svc_honey_account

# Verify Ghost SPN is registered
setspn -L svc_honey_account

# Verify Ghost Share exists
Get-SmbShare -Name "Finance_Honey"

# Verify file auditing is enabled
Get-Acl "C:\path\to\ghost\file.txt" | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Audit
```

### Log Locations

| Log Type | Location |
|----------|----------|
| GhostChaser Audit | `C:\ProgramData\GhostChaser\Logs\` |
| Windows Security | Event Viewer > Windows Logs > Security |
| Windows System | Event Viewer > Windows Logs > System |
